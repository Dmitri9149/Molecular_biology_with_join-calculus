### Molecular Biology with join calculus

This is draft version of Molecular Biology project using 
join-calculus for the description of the intercellular processes like: 
cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell moving within a comlex name space of body, virus or bacteria interaction with cells etc..

The join calculus is used in the form of JOCaml programming language: 
http://jocaml.inria.fr/doc/index.html  See the installation details there . The JoCaml is parallel disctibuted processes extention to the 
OCaml. 

The language is used as a metalanguage for description of the computational nature of the biological processes. So, what is happening is explained in JoCaml code + comments to the code. 

The ready 'chapters' (every in its own file):
/bio/mol_biol

- super_bacteria.ml -> simple pattern of interaction of environment and groving cells. 
- cell_differentiation.ml -> in progress.....
